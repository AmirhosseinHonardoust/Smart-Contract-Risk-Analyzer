# Smart-Contract-Risk-Analyzer
A lightweight static analysis engine for Solidity smart contracts. Extracts code features, detects dangerous patterns (delegatecall, tx.origin, call.value), computes heuristic risk scores, and classifies contracts into Low/Medium/High risk levels. Includes multiple example vulnerabilities and a clean CLI for rapid security assessment.
